### About me

I am postdoctoral researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich, working in the [Foudation of Cryptography](https://foc.ethz.ch/) group led by [Dennis Hofheinz](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/dhofheinz/).
Previously, I completed my PhD in cryptogtaphy at [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.https://www.unict.it/org/people/) under the supervision of [Ignacio Cascudo](https://software.imdea.org/~ignacio.cascudo/) in June 2025.
I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in mathematics from the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/) under the supervision of [Dario Catalano](https://catalano.dmi.unict.it/).

My research focuses primarily on theoretical problems in cryptography, including the feasibility of constructions under minimal assumptions and their limitations either in the standard model or idealized ones (e.g., ROM, GGM, GAM). I am also interested in blockchain applications (such as consensus and secret sharing) and steganography.
