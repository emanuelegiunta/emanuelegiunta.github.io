### Crypto Template
I have a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/emanuelegiunta/crypto_template?tab=readme-ov-fil) I use for research papers, originally forked from [Matteo Campanelli's](https://github.com/matteocam/lncs-latex-template). Feel free to fork it, copy parts of it, or help me improve it!

### Non-Research Interests
Here you can find interests of mine unrelated to research I am always happy to discuss about.

* Along with *Italian* and *English*, I speak some *Spanish* and *Chinese*, and I am currently starting *German*. Feel free to come and help me practice these last three languages any time, or to approach me to practice your Italian if you wish.

* I am generally into [boardgames](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Jtuma), and in particular I am an ethusiast [hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) player following the [H-Convetions](https://hanabi.github.io/). If I happen to own a game you wish to try and we happen to go to the same conference, do let me know.

* I am a long time [NetHack](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page) player, which is a [fun](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Fun) game I have been playing on [NAO](https://www.nethackscoreboard.org/players/W/WizardOfTuma.all.html) starting July 2025.
